According to WHO, in 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight, and of these, over 650 million were obese. But I need the percentage of adults who are overweight, which includes both overweight and obese individuals? No, overweight is a category that often includes pre-obesity, but let\\'s clarify the definitions.\\n\\nTypically, overweight is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25 or higher, and obesity is a subset with BMI 30 or higher. So the percentage for overweight should include those with BMI >=25.\\n\\nNow, what was the global percentage in 2016? I think I\\'ve seen that around 39% or 40% of adults were overweight. Let me think.\\n\\nI recall that in 2016, WHO reported that approximately 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight. That sounds familiar. Let me double-check.\\n\\nI should also consider that this might be an average global figure. It varies by region, but the question is about global percentage.\\n\\nOption C is 40%, which seems plausible. But let\\'s look at the options: A:10% â€“ that seems too low. B:20% â€“ also low. D:80% â€“ that seems too high for global average; that might be for specific countries like the US, but not globally.\\n\\nFor example, in the US, around 70% are overweight or obese, but globally it\\'s lower because many countries have lower rates.\\n\\nAccording to WHO data from 2016: \"Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese. Overall, about 13% of the world\\'s adult population (11% of men and 15% of women) were obese in 2016. The prevalence of overweight among adults was 39% in 2016.\"\\n\\nYes, that\\'s what I thought. So 39% is approximately 40%.\\n\\nLet me confirm the source. This is from WHO factsheets. I can cite it mentally.\\n\\nThe question says \"overweight,\" and WHO uses \"overweight\" to refer to BMI >=25, which includes obesity, but in their reports, they often state the overweight percentage as inclusive.\\n\\nIn the quote above, it says \"the prevalence of overweight among adults was 39% in 2016.\" And that includes those who are obese as well, since obesity is a subset.\\n\\nSometimes, people separate overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obesity (BMI >=30), but the question says \"overweight,\" which might be ambiguous. However, in global health contexts, \"overweight\" often refers to BMI >=25.\\n\\nLooking back at the WHO data: they say \"1.9 billion adults were overweight,\" and that\\'s BMI >=25, including obese.\\n\\nThen, 1.9 billion out of how many adults? Global adult population in 2016.\\n\\nWorld population in 2016 was about 7.4 billion. Adults aged 18 and over might be around 5 billion or so? Let\\'s estimate.\\n\\nRoughly, about 70% of the world population is adults (ages 15-64, but 18 and over might be similar). In 2016, population was about 7.4 billion. The proportion aged 18 and over: I think it\\'s around 65-70%. For simplicity, WHO gives the percentage directly as 39%, so I don\\'t need to calculate.\\n\\nWHO states: \"In 2016, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over (39% of men and 40% of women) were overweight.\"\\n\\nYes, so it\\'s 39%, which rounds to about 40%.\\n\\nTherefore, option C: 40% is correct.\\n\\nBut let\\'s see why the other options are wrong.\\n\\nA: 10% â€“ that\\'s way too low. Even in regions with low overweight rates, like some parts of Asia or Africa, the global average is much higher.\\n\\nB: 20% â€“ still low. For example, in 1975, it was around 20%, but by 2016, it had increased significantly.\\n\\nD: 80% â€“ that\\'s only in high-income countries or specific places. Globally, it\\'s not that high.\\n\\nFor instance, in the US, about 70-75% are overweight or obese, but globally, it\\'s lower.\\n\\nSo, based on WHO data, 39% is the figure.\\n\\nI recall that the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration also has data, but it aligns with WHO.\\n\\nTherefore, I think C: 40% is the answer.\\n\\nThe question says \"as of 2016,\" and WHO uses that data.\\n\\nAlso, the answer should be justified.\\n\\nSo, for the response, I need to ponder and justify, then give the answer.\\n</think>\\nThe question asks for the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight globally as of 2016. To answer this, I need to rely on authoritative global health data, particularly from sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), which tracks such statistics.\\n\\n- Overweight is typically defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25 or higher, which includes the obese category (BMI â‰¥ 30) in most global health reports.\\n- According to the WHO, in 2016, approximately 1.9 billion adults worldwide were overweight, including those who were obese. This represented about 39% of the global adult population aged 18 and older. Specifically, the WHO\\'s 2016 data shows that 39% of men and 40% of women fell into this category.\\n- Reviewing the options:\\n  - A: 10% is too low, as even regions with the lowest rates (e.g., parts of Southeast Asia or Africa) had higher averages, and globally, rates have risen significantly since the 1970s.\\n  - B: 20% is also low; this was closer to the global average in the 1980s, but by 2016, rates had nearly doubled due to factors like urbanization, diet changes, and reduced physical activity.\\n  - C: 40% aligns closely with the WHO\\'s 39% figure, which is often rounded to 40% in summaries and reports for simplicity.\\n  - D: 80% is unrealistically high for the global average; this may reflect rates in specific high-income countries (e.g., the United States, where about 70-75% of adults were overweight or obese in 2016), but it does not represent the worldwide figure, which includes lower rates in many developing regions.\\n\\nThe WHO is a primary source for global health metrics, and their data is widely cited in similar contexts. Other sources, such as the Global Burden of Disease study, corroborate this approximate percentage. Therefore, based on the evidence, option C is the most accurate.\\n\\n#ANSWER: C', 'is_correct': True, 'inference_time': 44.41864991188049}]\n"
